I realized doing this exercise that I am not particularly good at working with files on a more involved level.
I conceptually knew what I wanted to do - go to the end of the file and read up in chunks - I just didn't know how to work with file objects to implement it. I decided to just use the solutions as a learning opportunity :)

If referencing in the future, just go read through the solution code and explanation on the Python Morsel's website.
